    You find a castle and see a warlock looking at you and you go up to him carefully and then say "Can you direct me to king aruter, I am khight of the round table,I woke up in a cave and i need to go back to his castle".
    The warlock turns around and points to the horizen in front of him and he says in a low voice 300 paces to the north and you will find your castle.
    And so you begin your trecheraus path to the castle.
